# Yet another frakking MPD Client.

https://code.google.com/archive/p/client175/

Client175 is a full featured MPD web client that provides all of the functionality of a desktop application in your favorite web browser. It was originally named ExtMPD, but I recently found out that the name had already been used. This is, by my count, the 175th client written for MPD. We ran out of catchy names a long time ago, and in my frustration I decided Client175 is the only reasonable name at this point!

The current version supports all the basic features you'd expect, including tag editing, cover lookup, and lyrics lookup/editing.

The client has been tested in Firefox 3.6.x and recent releases of Chrome on Linux. Thanks to the ExtJS javascript library, it should be compatible with all major browsers, even IE 6 (not that you should use IE 6 for anything).

See the GettingStarted page for instructions on setting up the server.
